# Full_Adder_Priority_Encoder_VLSI
Problem 1 :
Design an 8 bit full adder using 1 bit full adder modules and add these two binary numbers: 8’b10110101 and 8’b10100111

Note:
You have to generate the RTL schematic of the adder.


Problem 2: 
Design a 4 to 2 priority encoder (0>1>3>2) using Verilog HDL and verify using timing diagram.

Note:
Show and discuss the case when multiple input bits are high.
